# Project Raven Frontend

[project_raven_backend](https://github.com/mohammadlebzo/project_raven_backend)

## Tech-Stack / libraries (Main)
- React
- React-Dom-Router
- MUI (Material UI)
- Styled Components

## Get started

- Start the dev server:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

**Note: make sure that the backend and docker mysql container are running**

- Login user (***exactly, case sensitive and everything***):

    ```bash
    {
        "username": "Raven",
        "password": "raven621",
    }
    ```

## Page Samples (more in the project):

***Notes:***
- ***Design still needs some more work, but I gave it my best shot with the time I had + current company work.***
- ***For the design choice I wanted it to look more like game menus (or something fun) but did not have enough materials to properly populate the pages (mostly desktop).***
- ***For the code name 'Raven' it's just a code name I use for many of my projects (long Story).***
- ***Screen break-points are 600px and 1600px (width), which is kind of supporting mobile, tablet and desktop like that.***
- ***Current mobile ratio shown below is the minimum ratio at which things would still look good/ok. Mobile width starting from 500px look much better***
    - ***I have the minimum ratio here to show that things would still hold up***
